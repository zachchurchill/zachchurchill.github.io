Kentucky Springs Distilling Co/James B. Beam Distilling Co,Basil Hayden's Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,80,"Artfully aged in Kentucky hillside rackhouses then bottled at a smooth 80 proof, Basil Hayden's sophisticated taste remains true to the old family recipe. With more rye than a traditional bourbon and its trademark spicy finish, it's easy to enjoy Basil Hayden's any way you like."
Buffalo Trace Distillery,Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,90,"...Made from the finest corn, rye and barley malt, this whiskey ages in new oak barrels for years in century old warehouses until the peak of maturity. The taste is rich and complex, with hints of vanilla, toffee and candied fruit. The smooth finish lingers on the palate. This will never change."
