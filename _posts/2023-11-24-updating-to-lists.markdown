What an excellent exercise in Liquid templating and introductory JavaScript!

After doing the bare minimum to get my website into the "no style, please!" theme,
I quickly realized that the previous table format used for my collections did not work on mobile screens.
Keeping with the spirit of the theme I wanted to make use of a simple unordered list as the basis for the new representation of the collections.
Although I essentially made each collection more unique to what was being captured,
I think this was necessary to effectively characterize how I want each collection to be thought of.
For instance:
- I care about how many books I read and wines I enjoy in each year,
not necessarily ensuring I show which authors and wineries, respectively, I have enjoyed.
Furthermore,
characterizing that I enjoyed a wine in a particular year helps me see the time difference between vintage and consumption.
- Meads are typically not characterized by vintage thus my grouping by meadery.
Additionally,
I do like to try as many meads from a single meadery as I can so this characterization better illustrates my motive.
- Ciders are similar to mead,
although I'm iffy on whether I'll keep this collection as it's not an active pursuit right now.

p.s. I removed the whiskeys collection as I don't really consume enough of it to keep track of at the moment.
