## prep work

### elevator pitch

Write down some elevator pitches about self that captures who I am, what I do & why I'm at the conference.
- I'm Zach Churchill, a tech lead at AEP focused on integrating GenAI into the enterprise.
However, I'm actually here on my own accord to reconnect with the folks from the Columbus tech scene &
learn more about how folks are thinking about AI outside of the enterprise setting.
- Hey, Zach Churchill. Yeah I'm here to expand from my technical skills to learn about the journey builders face when building a product,
specifically one that looks to incorporate AI/GenAI. It'd also be nice to reconnect with some folks I worked with at Root Insurance.

### goals

Define goals of attending the conference.
- Learn about the challenges builders/founders face at the beginning of their journey: product owner mindset, finances, & acquiring customers.
- Pick up some ideas around how folks are utilizing AI/GenAI in different settings.
- Reconnect/catch-up with at least one person I worked with at Root Insurance.
- Network with at least one person, focusing on learning more about them & why they are there.

### etc

Call-outs:
- I'm more focused on listening to the presentations & panel discussions instead of the workshops.
- I am not looking for new/more work, I am looking to build relationships for the future.

"Dream not just grind" (from "How Do I Get the Most Out of a Developer Conference or Event?" YouTube video by IAmTimCorey)
- I like this way of describing the giddiness I feel as I look forward to attending Construct I/O.
- Although building my own projects, like the Churchill Library, is invigorating,
I look forward to immersing myself into a scene/group of folks excited by the same topics.
I feel like this is how I stay excited about being a builder.

Past experiences with conferences/events:
- attending Utility Analytics Institute conference in 2017
- a random Google Cloud machine learning event in 2018 or 2019

## Conference notes

### Plan & Goals

Mostly followed above except I attended "Idea to Business Plan" at 2:45p & left afterwards.

Met my goals where Derek DeHart was the person from Root & Akshat Saladi was the other person (kind of a cheat but I'll take it!)
- One caveat is that my first goal was mostly fulfilled from the "Idea to Business Plan" talk

### Morning Session

- Talked with Akshat beforehand, checked out his site, interested in mobile & frontend, currently working with some folks on a start-up around a social calendar app.
- "COMP-U-SERVE" - Shareen mentioned this was "built in our (OSU) backyard", what is this?
- OSU has a "land grant mission" which roughly means that they are required to benefit the surrounding community.
- Look at the book "I am a strange loop" by Doug Hofstadter
- Look more into the "Center of Software Innovation"
- Etsy maintains marketing & centeredness towards humans by applying AI/GenAI into the workflow/experience rather than highlighting it e.g., utilizing metadata and tags on seller images automatically, intergrating Ai/GenAI to alleviate "sameness" of general search queries.
- TechStars fall cohort demo day is Dec 4th
- Strong technologist + deep domain expert is a successful pairing for founders of a start-up (Dan Manges)
- "How to cpature the most value with the limited engineering resources?" in addition to talent density are strong contributors to Dan M.'s success
- "How can we use AI to understand the most valuable & productive ways to build and design software?" - check out what RWX is doing around this with query languages and static analysis.
- Chase seems to have a surprising presence at OSU - briefly spoke with a couple folks from Chase.
- "Automatic Scientific Reasoning"; "ReAct; new research by Huan Sun.
  - How could this be useful for the DS team? What kind of Agents could be created for battery optimization?
  - checkout Mind2Web & SeeAct by OSUNLP
- AI Tinkerers monthly meet-ups coming to Columbus, first meet-up on Wed. Nov 6th
- "AI removes barriers between data silos and distribution channels" - Ash
- "AI can be instrumental at identifying and building your ideal customer profile (ICP) during ideation/business development" - Ash
- check out using Claude with "artifacts"

### AI Use cases

- **Etsy**: Uses LLM to help guide specificity of the search query; LLM end-to-end vs finetuned; also title rewriting using prompting to create similarities between other items.
- **Meta**: Works on Llama open-source team; started with fine tuning but failed miserably; then used RAG for Q&A agent for cutomer support; Llama stack for agentic & action-based workflows.
- **OSU**: OSU Libraries enormous amount of artifacts need to meet rules & regulations around accessibility; clean-up metadata & garbage to ensure materials/docs actually accessible for screen readers. Check out GitHub for architecture design.
- **Alignable**: 9.5M small businesses on network; identify & maintain connections to help grow businesses (70 employees). Utilizing LLM to help with taxonomy of business types to help improve search and identification of actual categorization/relationship building.
- "Can you talk with a book - load the content, context about author, etc?" - Derek & Cory
- Multi-modal + HITL for verification of search results - Etsy
  - Only being used in non-mission critical aspects like related items rather than completely new user-facing products.
- "Unsolvable problems not necessarily solvable but previously difficult problems have become tractable & less costly" - Derek
- Etsy - keeps ROI aligned with north star metrics, not looking to create a new framework to measure value.

### Idea to Business Plan

- Need to validate the idea - is the problem big enough/worth it? Do this before building the solution. Who's the target audience/ICP?
- Be way of biasing potential customers by sharing ideas and thoughts - work with them to validate the problem not the solution/idea.
- Find the product market fit
  - how does this tie into how the DS team generally works? Probably still good even if project-based.
- Use surveys to affirm what's picked up from qualitative conversations.
- User stores > Journey maps > Feature paths > Wireframes
  - don't go to the coloring book first.
- Don't reinvent the wheel; Find your differentiator; Avoid analysis paralysis => "Buy the basics; Build your IP"
