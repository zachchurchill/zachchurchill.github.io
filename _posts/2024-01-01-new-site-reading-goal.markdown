During the holiday break,
I decided to add a touch of pizzazz to my website by purchasing the domain
[zachurchill.com](https://www.zachurchill.com)
instead of sticking with the default GitHub Pages domain.
While I still use GitHub Pages to host my site using Jekyll,
I'm excited about the change.
Unfortunately *zachchurchill.com* was already taken,
but I'm pleased with *zachurchill.com* as it can be interpreted in two ways:
1. It incorporates my initials and last name, "Z. A. Churchill."
2. It highlights the "ch" from my first name, Zach, and my last name, Churchill.

As you can see in
[books]({% link books/index.html %}),
I read 18 books in 2023
(17 novels and 1 novella, excluding short stories and poems).
For 2024,
I've set a more ambitious goal of reading 24 books,
averaging 2 books per month.
After reviewing my personal library,
I've selected the following 12 books as part of my goal:
- "Iron Flame" by Rebecca Yarros (actually in my wife's library)
- "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle
- "The Iliad" & "The Odyssey" by Homer
- "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius
- "The Thunder Heist", "Across the Broken Stars" & "Kingdom of Dragons" by Jed Herne
- "The Daily Dad" by Ryan Holiday
- "The Splendid and the Vile" by Erik Larson
- "On Writing" by Stephen King
- "Whipping Star" by Frank Herbert

Additionally,
I want to continue reading short stories and poetry but I haven't decided how I'm going to track these.
I may decide to stick with journals,
like Ohio University's
[Quarter After Eight](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/quarter-after-eight/quarter-after-eight),
so then it'll just be easy to add them to the books log but I suppose we'll see.
