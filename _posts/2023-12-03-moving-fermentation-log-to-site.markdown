There we go!
Visibility on all of the
[ferments]({% link ferments/index.html %})
I've made is now available.

Moving this data to my site has finally removed my reliance on Google products to store my collections.
The fermentation log was a bit of a doozy but I'm happy I decided to go with JSON over CSV to store the data
(full data downloads on each page is forthcoming) -
it makes the data way more readable when editing and provides more flexibility in the schema e.g.,
I can keep the main 13 or so fields for each record but expand with carbonation and oaking for the ones that need it.

Although I got a simple representation of the log up in my collections,
I think there is more to be done.
That is,
this collection and some of the others like
[books]({% link books/index.html %})
are ripe for summarization and fancy graphs.
Not making any real promises,
but I think it may be interesting to try out incorporating some D3.js graphics in the future.
