After messing around with different websites and themes I landed on
[no style, please!](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/).

Given this website mainly serves as my mechanism to keep track of various lists,
and provide them in a format that's easy to share, I figure style is not too important.

My current set of collections are:
books,
meads,
wines,
ciders,
and whiskeys.

My hope is to expand on these with:
blog posts,
fermentation journal entries/project tracker,
and book "reviews".
