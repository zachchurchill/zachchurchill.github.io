As I mentioned in
[the post for the Churchill Library]({%- post_url 2024-08-02-starting-the-churchill-library-with-ruby-on-rails -%}),
I began a graduate program in Computer Science at
[Franklin University](https://cs.franklin.edu/program.php?id=mscs)
at the start of the year.
However, just a few weeks into my third course, "Analysis of Algorithms," I decided to end that pursuit.
I'm choosing **projects** over coursework. **Software engineering** over computer science. **As-needed** over preemptive learning.

## settin' the stage

Around this time last year, I was wrapping up my first year back at
[American Electric Power](https://www.aep.com/) (AEP)
as a principal data analyst.
It was my second year returning to data analytics after a 2.5-year stint as a software engineer (focused on data science platforms) at
[Root Insurance](https://www.joinroot.com/).
Unfortunately, things slowed down at AEP due to financial pressures.
I grew bored.

Fortunately, my team valued my software engineering skills.
I often drew on my experience to help solve problems and troubleshoot issues, which felt fulfilling.
It made me question whether I should have left software engineering.
At the same time, I doubted whether I had the background to transition back into engineering, especially outside the flexible startup environment.
I wanted structure and accountability &mdash; hence, the master's program.
(A bonus was that Franklin had a discount for AEP employees and AEP has a nice tuition reimbursement offering.)

Meanwhile, leadership directed our team to explore how generative AI could benefit the company.
Though initially slow to engage, I eventually found it interesting and valuable for AEP.
To my surprise, leadership moved quickly, and within a year, we onboarded a contractor to help us build an accelerator product to create a
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)-like experience.
Even better, I was entrusted as the technical lead on the project!
Working on integrating and now owning the product, dubbed *ChatAEP*, rekindled my passion for software engineering.

So, why stop a master's program designed to provide fundamental skills for a career in computer science?

## what is a builder?

Builders are people:
- who enjoy the creative and technical challenge of figuring things out &mdash; documentation splunking & learning on the spot is essential
- where the enjoyment and dopamine hits during the building process are oftentimes the only rewards needed &mdash; not always about the financials
- who don't shy away from intimidating projects that require planning and administrative work &mdash; they enjoy some process
- who embrace a *craftsman* mindset &mdash; skills are meant to be honed

## wrap-up

Being a builder, I see thoughtful self-learning as essential: what do I need to learn to successfully implement my ideas?

While preemptive learning in a classroom setting can open minds to new topics and methods,
I've realized that I'm capable of identifying gaps in my knowledge and finding resources to address them when needed.
While I'm not perfect, this approach excites me far more than the slow-moving, low-engagement classroom experience Iâ€™ve encountered in the past.

Using the additional time I've given myself by dropping out of the program,
I am holding myself accountable to complete the following by the end of the year:
- Finish "The Churchill Library" (see [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/x4d32jKo/the-churchill-library))
- Read through "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" to decide if I want to continue using Ruby as my backend language
- Read & journal about "The Pragmatic Programmer" to improve my software craftsmanship
- Write more on my website to help publically share my learnings and musings
