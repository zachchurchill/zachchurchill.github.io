Write down some elevator pitches about self that captures who I am, what I do & why I'm at the conference.
- I'm Zach Churchill, a tech lead at AEP focused on integrating GenAI into the enterprise.
However, I'm actually here on my own accord to reconnect with the folks from the Columbus tech scene &
learn more about how folks are thinking about AI outside of the enterprise setting.
- Hey, Zach Churchill. Yeah I'm here to expand from my technical skills to learn about the journey builders face when building a product,
specifically one that looks to incorporate AI/GenAI. It'd also be nice to reconnect with some folks I worked with at Root Insurance.

Define goals of attending the conference.
- Learn about the challenges builders/founders face at the beginning of their journey: product owner mindset, finances, & acquiring customers.
- Pick up some ideas around how folks are utilizing AI/GenAI in different settings.
- Reconnect/catch-up with at least one person I worked with at Root Insurance.
- Network with at least one person, focusing on learning more about them & why they are there.

Call-outs:
- I'm more focused on listening to the presentations & panel discussions instead of the workshops.
- I am not looking for new/more work, I am looking to build relationships for the future.

- I like this way of describing the giddiness I feel as I look forward to attending Construct I/O.
- Although building my own projects, like the Churchill Library, is invigorating,
I look forward to immersing myself into a scene/group of folks excited by the same topics.
I feel like this is how I stay excited about being a builder.
