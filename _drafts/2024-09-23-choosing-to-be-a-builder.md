As I mentioned in
[the post for the Churchill Library]({%- post_url 2024-08-02-starting-the-churchill-library-with-ruby-on-rails -%}),
I started a graduate program in Computer Science from
[Franklin University](https://cs.franklin.edu/program.php?id=mscs)
at the beginning of the year.
However, only a couple weeks into my third course on "Analysis of Algorithms", now is when that pursuit ends.
I'm choosing projects over coursework. Software engineering over computer science. Practical over theoretical.

**some background**

Around this time last year I was wrapping up my first year back at
[American Electric Power](https://www.aep.com/), or AEP,
as a principal data analyst.
It was my second year being back in the data analytics space as an analyst after a roughly 2.5 year hiatus as a software engineer,
albeit data science platform focused, at
[Root Insurance](https://www.joinroot.com/).
Unfortunately, things were slowing down quite a bit at AEP due to financial pressures on the company;
I was getting bored.

Fortunately, my team valued my skills and abilities as a software engineer.
I oftentimes found myself drawing from my experience to help my team think about solutions and troubleshoot bugs.
This felt good.
I started to re-evaluate whether I should have moved away from software engineering.
However, I also began to doubt whether I had enough background to transition back to software engineering when outside of the flexibility and leniency of a start-up.
I wanted structure and accountability.
Thus, a masters program.
(It didn't hurt that I received both a discount and very nice reimbursement from AEP if I chose Franklin).

Over the same time period, leadership gave our team a directive to learn more about generative AI and how it could be useful for the company.
Although slow to be interested initially, I evenually found this to be interesting and potentially beneficial for AEP.
Our leadership moved fast - faster than I would have expected from my past experience at AEP.
In under a year our team would be onboarding a contracting company to help us set up an accelerator product to product a
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)-like experience.
Even better, I was entrusted to be the technical lead on the project!
Working to integrate and now own the product, dubbed *ChatAEP*, has invigorated the software engineering path for me.

So why stop a master's program that is aimed at providing me fundamental skills that could come in handy as a computer scientist?

**what do I mean by a builder**

One thing people quickly learn about me once I find something that interests me is that I'm a go-getter.
Not necessarily in the sense of management and dog-eat-dog, but I don't fuck around when I want to get something done.
I enjoy building things and don't the process/administrative work necessary to help break the work down for everyone to come along with the journey.
Furthermore, I am quite comfortable splunking through documentation and open-source code when figuring out how to get something working.
I love the creativity and power that is available to a software engineer -
able to affect the world with nothing more than computers running code written in a text editor (the only acceptable being
[vim](https://www.vim.org/)
/[neovim](https://neovim.io/)
of course).
Although I enjoyed my time at
[Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/)
during my undergraduate degree, I found that college really helped me understand how to teach myself how to understand hard material.
I found it difficult to put in the same passion during the master program courses because I know I'm capable of teaching myself more efficiently than the courses,
and with a lot less busy-work.
My happiest when I am honing my skills on a particular framework, building some project that allows to learn something new about the language and architecture that I decided to use.

**pitfalls**

Rosy as the last section is, this is a place I've been before when I first started out in the industry.
At the time I was a data scientist associate at AEP and interested in everything under the moon: machine learning, cybersecurity, web development, docker, statistics, you name it and I likely had it on my backlog.
This is **not** the way to learn. This is the way to burn out. Which I did.

This time around I have time on my side.
Well at least more experience than I did when first graduating.
This time around I accept that I do not have to be good at everything; I do not have to be interested in everything; I do not have to use my free time to get better at the same languages/frameworks I use at work (assuming I'm not infatuated, which I rarely am).
I do need to pick something that I want to be good at. I need to hold myself accountable to finishing projects. I need to use more free time to round out my practical software engineering skills e.g., design patterns, software architecture patterns, testing methodologies, using tools and frameworks that I enjoy using.

**CTA**

Thus, I am holding myself accountable to do the following by year end:
- finish "The Churchill Library", see [trello board](https://trello.com/b/x4d32jKo/the-churchill-library)
- read & utilize "The Well Grounded Rubyist" to help decide whether I want to continue using Ruby as my backend language
- read & journal about "The Pragmatic Programmer" to grow my software craftsmanship
- write more on my website
